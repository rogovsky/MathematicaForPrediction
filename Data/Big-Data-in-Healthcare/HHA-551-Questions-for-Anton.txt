Q5: what percent of your work day would you say is learning compared to doing daily tasks?
    1. Python as many believe is a springboard into other programming languages and convenient for beginners in programming due to it being easier to learn compared to many other languages. Why do you prefer RStudio than Python?
    2. In other to be successful data analytics, what are the most important skill sets needed?
    3. In the hiring process, most organizations look out for experienced people or at least someone from a healthcare background. How can a fresh graduate with no healthcare background or sufficient experience tap into the informatics field?
    4. What are the current challenges facing Big Data technology with preference to healthcare?
    5.  What’s the prospect of data analytics in healthcare?
    6. Are there any up-and-coming programming languages we should be aware of, especially with regards to Big Data?
    7. How much emphasis do you place on coding techniques like scripting, especially to help process huge amounts of data within a reasonable time frame?  Are there other techniques you use to help expedite data processing?
    8. Do you think we will ever realize the promised potential of artificial intelligence (AI), and if not, what is keeping us from doing so?
    9. Do you think upcoming data analysts and scientists should be more well-rounded in their education?  If so, do you think this can help address some of the shortcomings experienced by current AI implementations?
    10. When you were developing digital media recommendation algorithms, what feedback did you get? Did it help meaningfully improve the code?  Did you find having more information about an individual improved retention rates of recommendations?

    1. What role does data analytics play in the current reorganization of the healthcare?
    2. All the data management tools are prone to manipulation by certain individuals to achieve an end. How well can the tools be designed to minimize such manipulation?
    3. What skills does an individual require in order to be a success at data analytics?
    4. In as much as a tool such as python is conceptualized as a springboard that is highly valuable in language programming particularly to those not conversant with it, what other reasons people prefer it over RStudio.
    5. The informatics seem to be favoring people with knowledge about it, how can the healthcare then accommodate those without the same knowledge?
