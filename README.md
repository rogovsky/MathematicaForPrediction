## Mission statement

This open source project is for Mathematica (Wolfram Language) implementations of statistical and Machine Learning 
algorithms that can be used for data analysis, forecast, prediction, and recommendation systems.

## License matters

## Organization

The algorithms implementations are given in Mathematica package files ("*.m"). 

Explanations or presentations about the algorithms are given in Mathematica notebook files ("*.nb"), in 
[PDF files](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForPrediction/tree/master/Documentation), 
or in 
[Markdown files](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForPrediction/tree/master/MarkdownDocuments).

Here are some fairly unique to the Mathematica / WL landscape algorithms:
- [mosaic plots](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/?s=mosaicplot);
- outlier identifiers;
- [associative rules finding]();
- [Prefix trees (Tries)](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/2013/12/06/tries-with-frequencies-for-data-mining/);
- [Quantile Regression](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/?s=quantile+regression);
- [Chernoff faces](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/2016/06/03/making-chernoff-faces-for-data-visualization/);
- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF);
- [Independent Component Analysis (ICA)](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/2016/05/23/independent-component-analysis-for-multidimensional-signals/);
- [Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForPrediction/blob/master/MarkdownDocuments/ROCFunctions-Example-Usage.md);
- [classifier ensembles](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForPrediction/blob/master/MarkdownDocuments/ROC-for-Classifier-Ensembles-Bootstrapping-Damaging-and-Interpolation.md);
- a framework for Linear vector space representations of document collections;
- an Item-item recommender framework based on Sparse linear algebra;
- a generator of Naive Bayesian Classifiers (NBC's);
- [Functional parsers](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/natural-language-processing-with-functional-parsers/).

The implemented algorithms are (usually) well documented. There is a fair amount of documents with related applications.
There are also 
[monadic programming implementations](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForPrediction/tree/master/MonadicProgramming)
closely related to the "main directory" packages.

Some of the algorithms have counterpart implementations in R or other languages.

(The code in the R directory in this repository though is not updated, it is just kept for references.
See the corresponding, actively worked on, dedicated repository 
[R-packages](https://github.com/antononcube/R-packages).)
